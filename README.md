# MarketingCampaign_PowerBI
I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle. The data contains over 2000 rows and 28 columns. I have created a few DAX measures to analyze and visualize the dataset.

In the first page, I created visuals representing the sum of income by education, marital status, and country. Also, displayed count of customers, their kids and teens at home country-wise.

On second page, I demonstrated sum of responses, complaints, and different purchases country-wise.

On third page of my report, I created comparison visuals: Store vs web purchases, catalog vs deals purchases, and web visitors vs web purchases.

On forth page, I analyzed customer acquisition trend. Turns out the earliest date of acquiring the customer was 7/30/2012 and the latest acquired customer was on 6/29/2014. I also visualized the frequency of purchases depending on the educational levels.

Page 5 includes visualization of expenditures on various products in correlation with kids.

On page 6, I created a donut chart representing different campaigns and customers’ responses/complains on each of them. I also created column charts to demonstrate customers’ responses depending on their education and marital status. Lastly, I used Pie Chart to demonstrate the total money spent on each category (fish, meat, fruit, gold, etc.)

My page 7 shows the dashboard encompassing the main visualizations from each of the above mentioned pages.
